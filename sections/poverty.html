            <p class="typography-body">Poverty is not just a lack of income; it's a network of disadvantages, a
                "violation
                of human dignity," and an "inability of getting choices and opportunities." We can distinguish
                between two main types:</p>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Absolute Poverty:</strong> The deprivation of basic human needs, including food,
                        water, sanitation, clothing, shelter, health care, and education. The World Bank has
                        historically defined this as living on less than $1.90 a day. In 2015, this applied to
                        736 million people.</li>
                    <li><strong>Relative Poverty:</strong> Defined contextually as economic inequality within a
                        specific society. It measures a person's income or wealth relative to the other members
                        of that society.</li>

            <p class="typography-body">What is our moral obligation to help? Philosopher Nigel Dower, in his paper
                "World
                Poverty," challenges us to move from a mindset of "charity" to one of "justice."</p>

                <h4 class="typography-subheading">The Challenge</h4>
                <p>The core challenge consists of two facts:
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mt-2">
                    <li>A thousand million humans (a fifth of the world's population at the time of writing)
                        live in absolute poverty, suffering from malnutrition, high infant mortality, and
                        squalid conditions.</li>
                    <li>There are many individuals and governments in rich countries with the wealth and
                        resources to help reduce this poverty.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">The question is: <strong>Ought those of us who are well off to be doing all we
                        can to help?</strong> Is it a duty, or just a nice thing to do?</p>
            </div>
            <div id="ethics-poverty-justice" class="ethics-content mt-4 hidden">
                <h4 class="typography-subheading">Justice, Not Charity</h4>
                <p>Dower argues that "development" should not be seen as a form of "charity."</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Charity:</strong> This implies an optional act of kindness, benevolence, or
                        generosity. We feel good about doing it, but we are not morally required to.</li>
                    <li><strong>Justice:</strong> This implies a moral obligation or duty. Helping the poor is
                        something that is *required* of us, "whether we feel like it or not." Dower argues that
                        the "ultimate test of 'justice not charity'" is the recognition that the current global
                        economic structures are themselves unjust. The poverty of developing countries can be
                        seen as a result of exploitation and the siphoning of resources (like cheap labor) by
                        developed countries. Therefore, helping is not "giving," but "giving back"—an act of
                        rectification.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div id="ethics-poverty-caring" class="ethics-content mt-4 hidden">
                <h4 class="typography-subheading">How Much Caring?</h4>
                <p>Dower concludes that we have a "significant obligation to help," but not one that is
                    "relentless" or "overburdening." He doesn't give a specific percentage, as caring is an
                    "unquantifiable dimension."</p>
                <p class="mt-2">Instead, he argues that if we truly appreciate:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
                    <li>the facts of world poverty,</li>
                    <li>our global moral identity,</li>
                    <li>the seriousness of extreme suffering,</li>
                    <li>and what a good quality of life *really* consists in...</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">...then "we will care as we ought," consistent with maintaining our *own*
                    quality of life, but not our excesses.</p>

                        and Relative Poverty?</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-gray-700 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Absolute Poverty</strong> is the deprivation of basic human needs, like
                            food, water, shelter, and healthcare, regardless of location.</li>
                        <li><strong>Relative Poverty</strong> is defined by a person's economic status compared
                            to others in their *own* society (i.e., economic inequality).</li>

                        <li>It is the argument that helping to alleviate world poverty is not an optional act of
                            kindness (charity) but a moral *duty* (justice).</li>
                        <li>This duty is based on the idea that the existing global system is unjust and that
                            the wealth of rich countries is partially derived from the exploitation of poor
                            countries. Therefore, providing aid is an act of rectification, not generosity.</li>

                        <li>He argues for a "significant obligation," but one that is not "relentless" or
                            "overburdening."</li>
                        <li>He avoids giving a specific amount, saying instead that "caring is an unquantifiable
                            dimension." He concludes that we should care as much as we can "consistent with our
                            quality of life," implying we should sacrifice luxuries, but not our own well-being.
