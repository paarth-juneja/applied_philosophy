            <p class="typography-body">Freud revolutionized our understanding of the human mind. He proposed that our
                conscious thoughts and actions are heavily influenced by unconscious desires and conflicts. He
                developed two key models to explain this: the structural model (Id, Ego, Superego) and the
                psychogenetic model of development.</p>

            <h3 class="typography-card-title">Jean-Paul Sartre and Existentialism</h3>
            <p class="typography-body">Existentialism is a philosophy that emphasizes individual freedom,
                responsibility,
                and the subjective experience of life in what is believed to be a meaningless universe. Its most
                famous slogan, from Sartre, is "existence precedes essence."</p>

                    <div>
                        <p class="typography-body">This means that humans are born without a pre-defined purpose or
                            nature ("essence").
                            Unlike a paperknife, which is designed with a purpose before it is created, a human
                            being simply *exists* first. We are "thrown into the world" and then, through our
                            choices and actions, we define who we are. As Sartre said, <strong
                                class="text-highlight-success">"Man is nothing else but what he makes of
                                himself."</strong></p>
                        <p class="typography-body mt-2">This radical freedom is also a great burden. We are "condemned
                            to be
                            free," meaning we cannot escape our responsibility to choose. Every choice we make
                            defines not only ourselves but also our vision of what humanity ought to be. To
                            pretend we are not free, to blame our circumstances or our nature, is what Sartre
                            calls <strong class="text-highlight-danger">"bad faith."</strong> Authenticity, in contrast,
                            is courageously accepting our freedom and the total responsibility that comes with
                            it.</p>
