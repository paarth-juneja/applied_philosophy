            <p class="typography-body">The central debate of the 17th and 18th centuries concerned the source of human
                knowledge. Do we acquire it through pure reason, or is it derived entirely from sensory
                experience? Click on a concept below to see a side-by-side comparison of the views of Descartes
                (Rationalist) and Hume (Empiricist).</p>

                    <p class="typography-question">Q1: Explain the fundamental difference between
                        Rationalism and Empiricism.</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-gray-700 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Rationalism (Descartes):</strong> Argues that the primary source of all
                            knowledge is reason and innate ideas. The senses are considered unreliable and can
                            be deceptive.</li>
                        <li><strong>Empiricism (Hume):</strong> Argues that the only source of knowledge is
                            sensory experience. The mind is a "blank slate" at birth, and all ideas are derived
                            from sense impressions.</li>

                    <p class="typography-question">Q2: What is Descartes' "Cogito, ergo sum," and why is
                        it so important to his philosophy?</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-gray-700 space-y-1">
                        <li>The phrase means "I think, therefore I am."</li>
                        <li>It is the single, indubitable truth Descartes discovered after applying his method
                            of radical doubt to all his beliefs.</li>
                        <li>It is fundamentally important because it serves as the certain, foundational axiom
                            upon which he could build an entire system of knowledge based on pure reason, free
                            from the deceptions of the senses.</li>

                        "causality"?</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-gray-700 space-y-1">
                        <li>Hume argued that we can never empirically observe the "cause" itself—the necessary
                            connection between two events.</li>
                        <li>We only observe one event consistently following another (what he called "constant
                            conjunction").</li>
                        <li>Therefore, our belief in causality is not based on reason or observation, but is
                            simply a mental habit or an expectation formed by repeated experience.</li>
