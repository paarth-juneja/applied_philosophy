                    <p class="mb-4">The debate over abortion is one of the most contentious ethical issues of our time.
                        It centers on the profound conflict between the belief in the sanctity of life from conception
                        and the belief in a woman's right to bodily autonomy. Click the switch below to explore the core
                        arguments of each side.</p>

                            <p>Susan, a lawyer who paused her career to raise four children, is preparing to re-enter
                                the workforce. She becomes pregnant and discovers the fetus has Down syndrome. Fearing
                                that raising a child with a disability will permanently end her career aspirations, and
                                with uncertainty about the severity of the condition, she has an abortion without
                                telling her husband.</p>

                                should have shared the information with her husband?</p>

                            <p>This case pits a woman's personal autonomy and life aspirations against the moral status
                                of a fetus with a disability and her responsibilities to her partner. It is a conflict
                                between self-fulfillment, potential life, and marital trust.</p>

                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                                <li><strong>Utilitarian View (Mill):</strong> A utilitarian would calculate the overall
                                    happiness. Susan's action aims to maximize her own happiness and career fulfillment.
                                    However, it causes potential suffering for her husband if he finds out, and it ends
                                    a potential life that could have experienced happiness. The calculation is
                                    difficult: does Susan's potential happiness from a renewed career outweigh the loss
                                    of a potential life and the breach of trust with her husband? The uncertainty of the
                                    severity of Down syndrome further complicates predicting the child's potential for
                                    happiness versus suffering.</li>
                                <li><strong>Deontological View (Kant):</strong> A Kantian would focus on duties. By
                                    having the abortion to protect her career, Susan is arguably treating the fetus
                                    merely as a means to an end, violating the Categorical Imperative. Furthermore, by
                                    deceiving her husband, she is treating him as a means to her own ends, not as a
                                    rational being deserving of truth. Her action of lying cannot be universalized (if
                                    everyone lied in a marriage, the institution of marriage would lose its meaning).
                                    From a strict Kantian perspective, her actions are immoral on both counts.</li>
                                <li><strong>Virtue Ethics View (Aristotle):</strong> A virtue ethicist would ask what a
                                    virtuous person would do. Does Susan's decision reflect the virtues of courage (in
                                    facing a difficult life change), honesty (with her husband), and temperance
                                    (balancing her own desires with her family's needs)? Or does it reflect vices like
                                    selfishness or a lack of courage? The secrecy of her act strongly suggests a lack of
                                    the virtue of honesty and integrity within her relationship. A virtuous action would
                                    likely involve an open, honest discussion with her husband to find a balanced path
                                    that respects all parties involved.</li>

                            <h4 class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800">My Conclusion</h4>
                            <p>While Susan's desire to reclaim her professional life is understandable, her actions are
                                ethically problematic. The decision to have an abortion is deeply personal, but her
                                choice to deceive her husband is a clear moral failure that undermines the foundation of
                                her relationship. Philosophically, both Kantian and Virtue Ethics frameworks strongly
                                suggest her actions were immoral due to the deception and the treatment of others as a
                                means to her own ends. A Utilitarian view is more ambiguous but would have to weigh the
                                severe negative impact of her secrecy against her personal goals. Regardless of one's
                                stance on abortion itself, the lack of honesty with her partner is the most indefensible
                                aspect of her choice.</p>

                                <li><strong>Sanctity of Life:</strong> The belief that human life is sacred from

                                    therefore morally wrong.</li>
                                <li><strong>Potential Personhood:</strong> The argument that because a fetus has the

                                    potential grants it a right to life from the start.</li>
                                <li><strong>Sentience Criterion:</strong> The argument that if a fetus can feel pain
                                    (which some argue can happen at various stages of development), it is morally wrong
                                    to cause it suffering and death.</li>
