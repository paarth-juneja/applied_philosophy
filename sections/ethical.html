            <p class="typography-body">Ethics, or moral philosophy, is the branch that explores questions of right and
                wrong, good and evil. It seeks to answer fundamental questions like "How should I live a good
                life?" and "What are my duties to others?" Three of the most influential approaches come from
                Aristotle, John Stuart Mill, and Immanuel Kant.</p>

                <p class="typography-body"><strong>Aristotle's Virtue Ethics:</strong> For Aristotle, the goal of life
                    is 'eudaimonia'
                    or human flourishing. This is achieved not by following strict rules, but by cultivating a
                    virtuous character. A virtue is a "golden mean" between two extremes. For example, courage
                    is the mean between cowardice and recklessness. By practicing virtues, we develop a good
                    character and learn to make the right choices naturally.</p>
                <p class="typography-body mt-2"><strong>Mill's Utilitarianism:</strong> John Stuart Mill was a key
                    proponent of
                    Utilitarianism. This is a consequentialist theory, meaning it judges an action's morality
                    based on its outcome. The core principle is the <strong class="text-highlight-success">"greatest
                        happiness principle"</strong>: the right action is the one that produces the greatest
                    amount of happiness for the greatest number of people. It requires a calculation of
                    potential pleasures and pains resulting from a decision.</p>
                <p class="typography-body mt-2"><strong>Kant's Deontology:</strong> Immanuel Kant proposed a
                    deontological
                    (duty-based) ethical theory. He argued that morality is not about consequences but about
                    intention and duty. The moral worth of an action comes from acting out of respect for the
                    moral law. He formulated this law as the <strong class="text-highlight-vibrant">"Categorical
                        Imperative,"</strong> with one version stating: "Act only according to that maxim
                    whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law." In other
                    words, if you cannot rationally wish for everyone to act the way you are acting, then your
                    action is morally wrong.</p>

                        <li><strong>Mill's Utilitarianism:</strong> This is a consequentialist theory. The
                            morality of an action is judged solely by its outcome or consequences. The right
                            action is the one that maximizes overall happiness for the greatest number of
                            people.</li>
                        <li><strong>Kant's Deontology:</strong> This is a duty-based theory. The morality of an
                            action is judged by the intention behind it, not its consequences. An action is only
                            moral if it is done out of respect for a universal moral law (the Categorical
                            Imperative), regardless of the outcome.</li>
