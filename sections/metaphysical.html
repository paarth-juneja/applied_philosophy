            <p class="typography-body">Metaphysics tackles questions about the ultimate nature of reality. It asks:
                "What
                is ultimately real?" and "What is existence itself?" It attempts to go 'beyond physics' to
                understand the fundamental principles that govern all things, both seen and unseen.</p>

                <p class="typography-body"><strong>Materialism vs. Idealism:</strong> A central debate in metaphysics is
                    whether reality
                    is fundamentally physical or spiritual. <strong
                        class="text-highlight-vibrant">Materialists</strong>, like Democritus, argue that everything,
                    including consciousness, is made of matter. <strong class="text-highlight-calm">Idealists</strong>,
                    like Plato, argue that reality is ultimately
                    mental or spiritual; the physical world is just a manifestation of a higher realm of ideas.
                    This is a continuation of the old philosophical quest for a 'basic substance'.</p>
                <p class="typography-body mt-2"><strong>Change and Permanence:</strong> Metaphysics also explores the
                    problem of
                    change. How can something change yet remain the same thing? Heraclitus claimed "everything
                    flows," while Parmenides argued that true change is impossible. Aristotle provided a middle
                    ground with his concepts of 'form' and 'substance,' suggesting that an object's essential
                    'form' endures even as its material 'substance' changes. This question leads to inquiries
                    about personal identity: what makes you the same person you were ten years ago, even though
                    almost every cell in your body has been replaced?</p>

                        <li>Metaphysics seeks to understand the fundamental nature of reality, being, and the
                            world.</li>
                        <li>It asks questions that transcend the physical world, such as "What is ultimately

                        <li><strong>Materialism:</strong> The view that reality is composed entirely of physical
                            matter. Everything, including thoughts and consciousness, can be explained by the
                            interactions of material particles.</li>
                        <li><strong>Idealism:</strong> The view that reality is fundamentally mental, spiritual,
                            or conceptual. The physical world is seen as an illusion or a secondary
                            manifestation of a higher, non-physical reality (like Plato's World of Forms).</li>
