                    <p class="mb-4">Euthanasia, or "mercy killing," is the act of intentionally ending a person's life
                        to relieve their suffering. It is a complex ethical issue with several important distinctions.

                            <p class="mt-2 text-sm"><strong>Summary:</strong> Robert, a 24-year-old, is paralyzed from
                                the neck down, in great pain, and repeatedly asks his family to "put him out of his
                                misery". His brother confirms his wish and kills him. The brother is acquitted of murder
                                by reason of temporary insanity.</p>
                            <p class="mt-1 text-sm font-medium">Original Questions: Was what Robert's brother did moral?
                                Do you think he should have been brought to trial at all? Do you think he should have
                                been acquitted? Would you do the same for a loved one if you were asked?</p>
                            <p class="mt-2 text-sm"><strong>The Core Dilemma:</strong> This is a conflict between the
                                law, which forbids killing, and a personal moral duty driven by mercy to end a loved
                                one's unbearable suffering at their own request.</p>

                                <p><strong>Philosophical Analysis:</strong>

                                    <li><strong>Utilitarianism (Mill):</strong> The brother's action ended Robert's
                                        immense suffering, which could be seen as maximizing well-being and minimizing
                                        pain. However, it also caused legal and emotional turmoil for the brother and
                                        family. A utilitarian would have to weigh the relief of Robert's suffering
                                        against the negative consequences for the living.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Deontology (Kant):</strong> The act of killing violates the Categorical
                                        Imperative—it cannot be a universal law that people should kill family members,
                                        even if requested. It treats Robert's life as a means to an end (the end of
                                        suffering). Kantian ethics would strictly condemn the act as immoral, regardless
                                        of the compassionate motive.</li>
                                </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>My Conclusion:</strong> Morally, the brother's action is ambiguous; it was an
                                    act of mercy that was also an act of killing. Legally, he had to be brought to trial
                                    because a life was taken. The acquittal by reason of "temporary insanity" is a legal
                                    mechanism society uses to show mercy when the law itself is inflexible,
                                    acknowledging the extreme emotional pressure he was under. Answering whether I would
                                    do the same is impossible outside of such a tragic situation, but it highlights the
                                    profound gap between abstract moral laws and devastating human realities.</p>

                                euthanasia law based on "unbearable psychological suffering." Doctors later cancel the

                                    <li><strong>Autonomy (Mill):</strong> From a purely libertarian standpoint, Bleeken
                                        is an autonomous individual making a claim about his own life and suffering. If
                                        his suffering is truly unbearable and irreversible, Mill's principle of liberty
                                        would suggest he has the right to make that choice.</li>

                                        had sentenced him to prison as punishment and to protect others. Granting
                                        euthanasia could be seen as allowing a criminal to escape his just punishment,
                                        causing further pain to victims' families and undermining the justice system (a

                                <p><strong>My Conclusion:</strong> Bleeken’s request is a complex test of liberal
                                    euthanasia laws. While his psychological suffering may be real, granting euthanasia
                                    to a convicted murderer for non-physical reasons is ethically fraught. It conflates
                                    a medical procedure designed for mercy with an escape from a legal sentence. This
                                    seems to be a "slippery slope" scenario, where the definition of "unbearable
                                    suffering" is expanded beyond its original medical intent. I believe he should have
                                    remained in prison. Belgium's laws could be changed to specify that euthanasia
                                    cannot be used to circumvent a legal sentence and should be reserved for terminal or

                                euthanasia, citing a deteriorating quality of life and a desire to die with dignity

                                    <li><strong>Respect for Autonomy (Kant & Mill):</strong> Both cases are powerful
                                        arguments for autonomy. The individuals are rational, have lived full lives, and
                                        are making a considered judgment about their own future. Forcing them to live on
                                        against their will could be seen as violating their dignity and treating them

                                        counterargument. If society allows euthanasia for a "poor quality of life" or
                                        being "tired of life," where does it stop? Critics fear this would devalue the

                                        potentially creating subtle pressure on them to choose death to avoid being a
                                        "burden." This is a strong utilitarian concern about the potential negative

                                <p><strong>My Conclusion:</strong> These cases are ethically challenging because the
                                    individuals' requests are so rational and sympathetic. However, they represent the
                                    most dangerous territory for the "slippery slope." While it seems cruel to deny
                                    these specific individuals their wish, creating a legal framework that allows
                                    euthanasia based on a subjective "quality of life" assessment for non-terminal
                                    individuals is fraught with peril. It could open the door to abuses and devalue the
                                    principle of life itself. Society must err on the side of caution, restricting
                                    euthanasia to cases of unbearable suffering from terminal illness.</p>

                            <p class="font-semibold text-gray-800">Q1: What are the two primary principles used to argue
                                in favor of euthanasia?</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-gray-700 space-y-1">
                                <li><strong>Mercy:</strong> The argument that it is a compassionate act to end the
                                    unbearable and hopeless suffering of a patient.</li>
                                <li><strong>Respect for Autonomy:</strong> The argument that individuals have the right
                                    to self-rule and make their own rational decisions about their life and death.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p class="font-semibold text-gray-800">Q2: What is the "slippery slope" argument against
                                euthanasia?</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-gray-700 space-y-1">
                                <li>It is the argument that if society legalizes euthanasia in justified cases (like for
                                    terminally ill patients in great pain), it will inevitably lead to the acceptance
                                    and practice of euthanasia in unjustified cases.</li>
                                <li>The fear is that the initial moral reasons (mercy and autonomy) will be expanded or
                                    ignored, leading down a "slippery slope" to non-voluntary or even involuntary
                                    euthanasia.</li>

                                euthanasia.</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-gray-700 space-y-1">
                                <li><strong>Active Euthanasia:</strong> Involves taking a direct action to end a life,
                                    such as administering a lethal injection. It is an act of "killing".</li>
                                <li><strong>Passive Euthanasia:</strong> Involves withholding or withdrawing
                                    life-sustaining treatment, allowing the person to die from their underlying
                                    condition. It is an act of "letting die".</li>
