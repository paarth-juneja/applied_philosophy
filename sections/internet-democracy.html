            <p class="typography-body">Democracy ("rule of the people") is a form of government built on the values of
                justice, equality, and freedom. The internet, as a technology, is fundamentally an outcome of
                the value of freedom. Its open, affordable, and decentralized nature can be a powerful tool for
                supporting democracy.</p>

                    <h4 class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800">Case 1: The "Harmless" University Virus</h4>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-sm"><strong>Summary:</strong> Your friend is creating a "harmless" worm
                        that will display "Let's party!" on all university workstations on a Friday at 3 pm,
                        then erase itself by 4 pm. What would you say or do?</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-sm"><strong>The Core Dilemma:</strong> This is a conflict between
                        loyalty to a friend (a personal value) and the ethical duty to prevent harm (a social
                        value). Is a "harmless" prank that involves unauthorized access still a wrongful act?
                    </p>
                    <div class="mt-2 text-sm space-y-2">
                        <p><strong>Philosophical Analysis:</strong>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-4">
                            <li><strong>Deontology (Kant):</strong> The friend's action is fundamentally
                                immoral. His maxim would be, "It is acceptable to gain unauthorized access to a
                                computer system if my intention is harmless." This cannot be universalized; if
                                everyone did this, the very concepts of security, privacy, and property would
                                collapse. He is also treating the university (and its IT staff, who will have to
                                investigate) as a *mere means* to his end (a prank).</li>
                            <li><strong>Utilitarianism (Mill):</strong> The friend believes his action will
                                produce a small amount of "pleasure" (a party message) and no "pain" (it's
                                "harmless"). This is a bad calculation. The potential negative consequences are
                                huge: the worm could have an unforeseen bug, it could crash critical systems
                                (like exam databases or research projects), and it will cause panic and waste
                                the time of IT staff. The potential pain (high) far outweighs the potential
                                pleasure (low).</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>My Conclusion:</strong> The action is unethical. I would have a moral duty to
                            intervene. The first step would be to try to persuade my friend not to do it, using
                            the arguments above. If he refused, I would be ethically obligated to report him to
                            the university administration. The Kantian duty to uphold the rules of a just system
                            (respect for property and security) and the utilitarian duty to prevent a large,
                            foreseeable harm outweigh my personal loyalty to my friend.</p>

                        Anxiety</h4>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-sm"><strong>Summary:</strong> One study finds that *long* media use
                        before bed is associated with less sleep. However, *short, focused* media use (like
                        listening to music) in bed is associated with *more* sleep. A second study finds that
                        students who read supportive "likes" and comments on Facebook before an exam reduced
                        their anxiety and performed better.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-sm"><strong>The Core Dilemma:</strong> Is technology an inherent source
                        of anxiety and distraction, or is it a neutral tool whose impact depends entirely on
                        *how* we use it?</p>
                    <div class="mt-2 text-sm space-y-2">
                        <p><strong>Philosophical Analysis:</strong>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-4">
                            <li><strong>Aristotelian Virtue (Virtue Ethics):</strong> These cases are a perfect
                                example of Aristotle's "Golden Mean." Technology use is not a simple good or
                                bad. The *excess* (long, multitasking media use) is a vice that leads to less
                                sleep. The *deficiency* (no media) might be fine, but the *mean* (a short,
                                focused, purposeful session) is a virtue that can actually improve well-being.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Utilitarianism (Welfare):</strong> These cases show how to maximize
                                welfare using IT. The goal is to maximize pleasure (reduced anxiety, better
                                sleep) and minimize pain (anxiety, insomnia). The Facebook study is a clear
                                utilitarian win: a small, low-cost action (posting for support) produced a
                                significant increase in well-being and performance for a large group (anxious
                                students).</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>My Conclusion:</strong> These studies demonstrate that technology is not a
                            monolithic good or bad. It is a powerful tool that must be used with virtue and
                            wisdom. The "Bedtime" case shows that *temperance* is key—using media in moderation
                            and with a clear purpose. The "Facebook" case shows that IT can be a powerful tool
                            for fostering "social belonging," a key indicator of quality of life. The impact of
                            IT is not in the technology; it's in our *habits*.</p>
