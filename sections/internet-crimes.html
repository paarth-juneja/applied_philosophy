            <p class="typography-body">A "Cybernetic Society" is defined by the combined action of people, machines, and
                computers. This alliance, built on IT, has many advantages (e-commerce, research, global
                communication) but also disadvantages, including the rise of internet crimes.</p>

                <p class="typography-body">The core of the problem lies in the values of <strong>privacy</strong> and
                    <strong>anonymity</strong>. Computer users
                    want to protect their identity and work, but this same anonymity allows criminals to act.
                    This creates a range of "troublesome issues" that are ethical or legal violations.

                    <li><strong>Violation of Privacy:</strong> The unauthorized access to or use of someone's
                        personal data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hacking vs. Cracking:</strong> Hackers test the limits of a system, whereas
                        Crackers (a term for malicious hackers) intend to cause system problems or steal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Viruses and Worms:</strong> A virus is malicious code that needs human help to
                        spread, while a worm can propagate on its own, for example, by emailing itself to a
                        user's contacts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Software Piracy:</strong> The illegal copying or distribution of software, a
                        violation of intellectual property.</li>

            <h3 class="typography-card-title">The Computer User and Moral Responsibility</h3>
            <p class="typography-body">Given the risks of internet crime, what is our ethical duty? The concept of
                "Moral
                Responsibility" in a cybernetic society is defined as "a way of living one’s life through values
                and virtues, representing a strong mental condition of owning other computer users’ claims to
                live a virtuous or good human life."</p>

            <div class="elaboration mt-4 border-t pt-4">
                <p class="typography-body">This is an Aristotelian (Virtue Ethics) approach. It argues that a safe and
                    just internet is
                    not just about laws; it's about the *character* of the users.</p>

                    <li>It requires the "cultivation of values and corresponding virtues" such as <strong>truth,
                            courage, fairness, and compassion.</strong></li>
                    <li>The goal is to develop a "collective moral awareness" and a "sense of respect for the
                        dignity and well-being of other computer users."</li>
                    <li>This is especially true for the "alpha men"—the constructive, creative leaders of the
                        cybernetic society (e.g., programmers, tech leaders, influencers)—who have a greater
                        responsibility due to their power and influence.</li>
