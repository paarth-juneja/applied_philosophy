            <p class="mb-4">The earliest Greek philosophers, also known as the Pre-Socratics, were primarily
                concerned with the natural world and its fundamental principles. They sought to find rational
                explanations for natural phenomena, moving away from traditional myths. Their central question
                was: "Where does the world come from?" They believed that "nothing can come from nothing" and
                that there must be a basic, underlying substance from which everything else is made.</p>

                <p><strong>Thales (c. 624-546 BCE):</strong> Considered the first philosopher, Thales of Miletus
                    proposed that the source of all things is <strong class="text-blue-600">water</strong>. He
                    observed that water is essential for life, exists in solid, liquid, and gaseous forms, and
                    seems to be a part of everything. As "Sophie's World" explains, "When he was in Egypt, he
                    may well have seen how the fertile fields were 'created' by the Nile's floods... He might
                    also have seen how frogs and worms appeared after a rainfall." This was a revolutionary step
                    because it was an attempt to explain the world based on observation and reason, not divine
                    intervention.</p>
                <p class="mt-2"><strong>Anaximander & Anaximenes:</strong> Thales' successors also sought a
                    primary substance. Anaximander suggested an indefinite, boundless substance he called the
                    "apeiron," while Anaximenes believed <strong class="text-gray-500">air</strong> was the
                    origin of all things—air could be condensed into water and earth, or rarefied into fire.</p>
                <p class="mt-2"><strong>Democritus (c. 460-370 BCE):</strong> Democritus proposed the most
                    enduring idea: the atomic theory. He argued that everything is composed of tiny,
                    indivisible, and eternal particles called <strong class="text-purple-600">"atoms"</strong>
                    moving in a void. These atoms had different shapes and sizes, and by combining in various
                    ways, they formed all the objects we see. This was a purely materialistic philosophy,
                    leaving no room for gods or souls and explaining change as the rearrangement of atoms.
                    "Sophie's World" compares them to Legos: "They could be used to build anything... and
                    because they were eternal, they could be used over and over again."</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">This trio from Athens shifted the focus of philosophy from the natural world to
                ethics, knowledge, and politics. They laid the groundwork for almost all of Western thought that
                followed.</p>

            <div class="elaboration mt-4 border-t pt-4">
                <p><strong>Socrates (c. 470-399 BCE):</strong> Socrates famously said, "The unexamined life is
                    not worth living." He never wrote anything down; we know him primarily through the writings
                    of his student, Plato. His method, the Socratic dialogue, involved asking probing questions
                    to reveal ignorance and guide his interlocutors toward a deeper understanding. He believed
                    in an absolute truth and a universal moral standard, arguing that true knowledge leads to
                    virtuous action. As "Sophie's World" puts it, he was like a "gadfly" on the back of Athens,
                    stinging the citizens out of their intellectual complacency.</p>
                <p class="mt-2"><strong>Plato (c. 428-348 BCE):</strong> Plato's central idea is the <strong
                        class="text-teal-600">Theory of Forms</strong>. He argued that the physical world we
                    perceive through our senses is not the real world; it's merely a shadow or imitation of a
                    higher, eternal, and perfect world of Forms or Ideas. For example, every physical horse is
                    an imperfect copy of the perfect "Form of a Horse." True knowledge is attained not through
                    the senses, but through reason, by grasping these perfect Forms. His famous Allegory of the
                    Cave in "Sophie's World" illustrates this beautifully: prisoners in a cave mistake shadows
                    for reality, and only the philosopher who escapes the cave can see the true world (the world
                    of Forms) illuminated by the sun (the Form of the Good).</p>
                <p class="mt-2"><strong>Aristotle (384-322 BCE):</strong> A student of Plato, Aristotle diverged
                    from his teacher by focusing on the empirical world. He believed that reality is what we can
                    perceive with our senses. He did not believe in a separate world of Forms; instead, he
                    argued that the "form" of an object is inherent within the object itself. He was a great
                    organizer, categorizing logic, biology, ethics, and politics. He proposed the <strong
                        class="text-indigo-600">Four Causes</strong> (Material, Formal, Efficient, and Final) to
                    explain any object or phenomenon. For Aristotle, as "Sophie's World" explains, the highest
                    form of happiness (eudaimonia) comes from living a virtuous life according to reason,
                    finding the "golden mean" between extremes.</p>

                        <li>They moved from 'Mythos' (stories about gods) to 'Logos' (reason, logic, and

                        <li>Instead of attributing natural events to divine actions, they sought rational
                            explanations within nature itself.</li>
                        <li>They operated on the principle that "nothing can come from nothing" and thus
                            searched for a single, fundamental substance (an 'arche') that underlies all of
                            reality.</li>

                        <li><strong>Plato:</strong> Believed in a dual reality. The physical world we sense is
                            an imperfect shadow of the true reality, the eternal "World of Forms." True
                            knowledge is gained through pure reason by intellectually grasping these perfect
                            Forms.</li>
                        <li><strong>Aristotle:</strong> Believed in a single reality—the one we can observe with
                            our senses. An object's "form" is inherent within it, not in a separate world.
                            Knowledge is gained through empirical observation, categorization, and logic applied
                            to the natural world.</li>

                        <li>It was a form of dialogue based on continuous questioning.</li>
                        <li>The primary goal was not to "win" an argument, but to stimulate critical thinking
                            and expose contradictions in a person's beliefs.</li>
                        <li>By revealing a person's ignorance on a topic, Socrates aimed to guide them toward a
                            more robust and genuine understanding of truth and virtue.</li>
