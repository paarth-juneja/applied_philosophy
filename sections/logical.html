            <p class="typography-body">Logic is the study of correct reasoning. It's not concerned with *what* we think,
                but *how* we think. It examines the structure of arguments to distinguish valid reasoning from
                fallacious reasoning, providing the tools for clear and defensible thought.</p>

                <p class="typography-body"><strong>Arguments, Premises, and Conclusions:</strong> In logic, an
                    'argument' is not a
                    dispute but a set of statements. It consists of 'premises' (supporting claims) that are
                    intended to provide reasons for accepting a 'conclusion' (the main claim). For example: "All
                    BITSians are Indians (premise). All Indians are honest (premise). Therefore, all BITSians
                    are honest (conclusion)."</p>
                <p class="typography-body mt-2"><strong>Deductive and Inductive Reasoning:</strong> There are two main
                    types of
                    reasoning. <strong class="text-highlight-primary">Deductive reasoning</strong> moves from general
                    principles to a specific conclusion. If the premises are true, the conclusion *must* be
                    true. This provides certainty. <strong class="text-highlight-secondary">Inductive reasoning</strong>
                    moves from specific observations to a general conclusion. For example, "Every swan I have
                    ever seen is white. Therefore, all swans are white." This provides probability, not
                    certainty, because the next observation could prove the conclusion false (as happened when
                    black swans were discovered).</p>

                        and an inductive argument?</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-gray-700 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Deductive Argument:</strong> Aims for certainty. It moves from general
                            premises to a specific conclusion. If the premises are true, the conclusion is
                            guaranteed to be true. (Example: All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore,
                            Socrates is mortal.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Inductive Argument:</strong> Aims for probability. It moves from specific
                            observations to a general conclusion. The conclusion is likely, but not guaranteed,
                            to be true even if the premises are true. (Example: The sun has risen every day so
                            far. Therefore, the sun will rise tomorrow.)</li>
